Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
TODO None really the predictio stayed in line with the probability of same team winning

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
TODO I will definetly call for three.
